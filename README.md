# Via-Customer-Interaction-App
Fostering interactions between customers while using Viaâ€™s transportation services.

This project is an app similar to Tinder, in that it fosters interactions between users, but instead of trying to get both parties to date, the intention of this app is to get users of Via's buses to take their buses because they've made a connection on the app with another passenger who shares their hobbies and interests.
